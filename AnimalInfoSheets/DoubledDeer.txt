How big is it? About deer sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Spawns in polluted forests and cold forests.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. It should be half-decent for meat but give fairly weak leather.
