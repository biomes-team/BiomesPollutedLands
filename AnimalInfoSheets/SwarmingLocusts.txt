How big is it? About cat sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Omnivore, eats literally anything they can. 
Where does it live? Spawns in all non-icesheet/sea ice polluted biomes.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, in large groups like alphabeavers. 
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. They should be event only and have insane hunger rate. The only thing that should keep them from eating should be needing to sleep. They should also product a ton of animal filth.
