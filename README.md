# Biomes! Polluted Lands

Biomes! Polluted Lands, adding an assortment of new plants and animals to polluted vanilla biomes and some modded ones. Have you ever tried out living in a polluted biome, whether it be settling in one or polluting your home tile and found it really really boring? Well this mod is for you, because it makes polluted biomes feel much more alive and interesting, a far cry from the bleak and boring vanilla versions. From mutated predator birds to parasitic pests, you'll have lots of new things to play with (and your pawns to die to).

~ Over 30 new animals, from adorable glowing lizards and green-tinged sheep to mutant bugs that want to kill your pawns!

~ Over 30 new plants, including new crops for growing on polluted terrain

~ New power armor for keeping your pawns safe from danger both physical and toxic

~ Over a dozen unique mutation-based genes, known as "Mutagenes"

~ Polluted-biome-exclusive events
