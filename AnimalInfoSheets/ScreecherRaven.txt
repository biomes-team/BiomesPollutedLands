How big is it? A little smaller than pawns.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator.
Where does it live? Spawns in all non-cold polluted biomes if they have a river or coast. Spawns most often in swamps. (Spawns in swamps normally)
Does it spawn in packs? Nope, it's solitary.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Its shell should be fairly weak and its leather not very good. Maybe it should give a new type of shell and give lizardskin? If it gives a new type of shell textile, it should be unique to Polluted Lands.

Its attacks should have a really high stun chance.

It should be a flying creature using Pathfinding Framework.
