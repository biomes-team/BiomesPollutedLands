How big is it? Slightly smaller than vanilla huskies.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Same diet as vanilla dogs.
Where does it live? Rarely spawns in polluted vanilla biomes that are arid or forested but not swampy.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, in groups up to 3 or 4.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Good pets and good attack animals. They should use the pack defense and pack hunting comps both.
