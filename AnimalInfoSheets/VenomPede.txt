How big is it? About cat sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predatory Carnivore.
Where does it live? Spawns in polluted jungles only.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. It should give a decent chitin. It should be surprisingly tough for its size.

Its fang attacks should deal toxic buildup.
