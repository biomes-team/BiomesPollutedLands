How big is it? A little bigger than dogs.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predatory carnivore.
Where does it live? Spawns in swamps and forests.
Does it spawn in packs? Nope, it's solitary.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Should give decent chitin. It should lure in prey using the Lure comp and its attacks should have a good stun chance.
Should be rarely milkable for glow pods. 
If possible, it should produce light ONLY when using the lure ability!

It should be a flying creature using Pathfinding Framework.
