How big is it? About cow sized, maybe a little bigger.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Spawns in mostly colder biomes but rarely in non-cold ones. Does not spawn in swamps.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, up to groups of 3.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Should give really weak leather. It should have amazing carry weight!

When attacked it should produce a lot of rotstink and try to flee instead of fight back.
