How big is it? About rabbit sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Spawns in polluted swamps.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. It should give a weak amphibianskin.

When attacked, it should deal very intense toxic buildup to attackers.
