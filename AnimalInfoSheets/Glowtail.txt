How big is it? About cat sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Carnivore but should mostly eat from terrain. Text should be something like "Luring in bugs"
Where does it live? Spawns in polluted warmer vanilla biomes.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. It should be a really good pet for nuzzling.

If possible, it should produce one tile of light whenever it's eating, but ONLY when it's eating.
