How big is it? A little bigger than thrumbos.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator. Can eat meat, eggs, and animal products.
Where does it live? Spawns in all polluted biomes. Event only, like a thrumbo. 
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Should be stronger, especially more durable than as a thrumbo but slower to make up for it. It should have a special mouth attack that inflicts a slowing debuff on enemies.

It should give a special chitin with great sharp armor.
