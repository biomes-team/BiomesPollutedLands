How big is it? Vanilla sheep sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Rarely spawns in polluted vanilla forested biomes that are NOT swamps.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes, in groups up to 5 or 6.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Shearable for a wool that provides good toxic protection, roughly 25% per piece, so a pawn with pants, shirt, hat, and jacket or something will be fully protected. The wool however releases tox gas and pollution if burned.
